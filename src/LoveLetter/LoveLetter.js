            It‚Äôs been a year since we first started talking. In that time, two
            of your birthdays have already passed, yet I still feel like I
            haven‚Äôt given you a gift that truly reflects how much you mean to
            me. This may not be the best, but I hope you can see the love and
            effort I‚Äôve poured into it.
            <br />
            <br />
            I‚Äôm truly grateful to God for bringing you into my life. You are one
            of the most wonderful gifts He has ever given me. Things weren‚Äôt
            always easy at the start, but we made it through ‚Äî and now I get to
            call you my girl.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for supporting me,
            even from afar. Thank you for loving me unconditionally. There are
            countless things I want to thank you for, but no letter would ever
            be long enough to contain them all. And along with those thank-yous,
            there are just as many apologies for the times I‚Äôve fallen short.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, I want to wish you the happiest of birthdays. I pray that you
            always stay true to yourself, and that every dream you hold in your
            heart becomes reality. Remember, I‚Äôll always be here cheering you on
            üòâ. On this 24th birthday, I also hope you continue to grow ‚Äî not
            only in wisdom and maturity, but also spiritually. May God bless
            every path you take and may you always submit to Him and His word.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lastly, I hope you‚Äôll continue to be patient with me ‚Äî and
            especially with my silly jokes üòú. Please know I tease you only
            because I love you and feel so comfortable being myself around you
            üòò.
            <br />
            <br />
            As I close this letter, I just want to say that my greatest hope is
            for us to keep growing together as partners. May we always support
            one another through every step ahead. Storms may come, but I believe
            we can face them side by side, never against each other.
            <br />
            <br />I love you, Olyn. Here‚Äôs to many more years together. Once
            again...
